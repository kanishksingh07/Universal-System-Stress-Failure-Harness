# 🚀 Future Systems: The Probabilistic Paradigm

## 1. Beyond Determinism
Traditional software engineering strives for determinism (`if x then y`). However, modern AI agents, distributed blockchains, and quantum networks are inherently probabilistic. They don't have "bugs"; they have "drifts" in probability.

## 2. What This Harness Enables
By adopting a Quantum-Adversarial approach today, we prepare for:

* **Non-Deterministic AI Testing:** LLMs do not output the same text twice. A "Pass/Fail" test is useless. A "Confidence Score" test is essential.
* **Race Condition Discovery:** Classical tests rarely catch race conditions because they run sequentially. A Superposition Engine firing probabilistic shots is statistically likely to trigger rare race conditions that occur only 0.1% of the time.
* **Anti-Fragile Systems:** Systems that can dynamically adjust their own "Stability Index" in real-time, rejecting requests when their internal variance gets too high.

## 3. Conclusion
We are moving from "Software Verification" (Is it right?) to "System Uncertainty Management" (How wrong might it be?). This harness is the first step in that direction.

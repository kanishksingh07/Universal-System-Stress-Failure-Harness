# 📂 Quantum-Adversarial Harness (Task 2) - Handover

## Overview
This repository now contains a **Quantum-Inspired Stress Layer** capable of probabilistic testing.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Configuration
Edit `config/probability-config.yaml` to define your "Superposition States" (Normal, Attack, Boundary) and their weights.

### 2. Execution (The Superposition Engine)
Run the probabilistic batch:
```bash
python superposition_runner.py
